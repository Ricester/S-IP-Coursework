# S-IP-Coursework
Portfolio for S&amp;IP
Task 1 - Vector Graphics
I took inspiration from Damien Hirst's dot paintings, specifically from https://www.josephklevenefineartltd.com/artists/damien-hirst/damien-hirst-bromobenzotrifluoride.html
I decided to use a more pastel set of colours for the spots being generated, and having the size and colour randomly generated each time the program is run added some more variety to it. 
The spots are all neatly lined up no matter the size or colour, drawing inspiration from Hirst's work.

Task 2 - Sound and Visuals Synthesizer
My inspiration came from the suggestion of the sounds of the sea, and I downloaded a .wav file from the Freesound library of waves. I originally wanted it to be like watching waves approaching the shore but changed that in favour of a more practical UI.
The instrument is controlled by holding down the 's' key and moving the mouse either on the vertical or horizontal axis. There is an indicator showing the changes in the sound, as well as a waveform on the screen.

Task 3 - Forest Scene
